Bio::Phylo - Phyloinformatic analysis using Perl
================================================

Documentation branch
--------------------

Welcome to the `gh-pages` branch of the Bio::Phylo repository.
This branch is primarily used to create and manage content for
the [website](rvosa.github.io/bio-phylo). Hence, this branch 
contains documentation-related files that are not part of 
Bio::Phylo's POD. In other words, the following things are 
welcome here:

- anything to set up HTML generation to produce the web pages
  at rvosa.github.io/bio-phylo. Configuration files, templates,
  images, javascripts, stylesheets, etc.
- any text files that are intended to be processed by the HTML
  generation, i.e. markdown documents with tutorials, code 
  samples, example input and output files, etc.
- any files having to do with the manuscript for API v2.0, i.e.
  files for LaTeX

Things that are NOT welcome here:

- anything to do with documentation that users are going to 
  install locally, i.e. POD documents such as 
  Bio::Phylo::Manual
