% Possible reviewers that I know personally include:
% - Chris Fields
% - Denis Baurain
% - Daisie Huang
% In addition, there are people that appear to be users but that I don't know:
% - Hayward, Alexander 
% - Jern, Patric
% The general idea here is that these are people I haven't published with (yet).
% The BioPerl people's page provides a murderer's row of other candidates, though
% quite a few I already have published with, so there's a potential for COI.
% Here's the list: https://github.com/orgs/bioperl/people
% Also, all people on the previous publication, or people that have since 
% been added to the Acknowledgements in the README.md are obviously out.

\abstract{\textbf{Motivation:} Phylogenetic analysis is a broad and expanding field that
requires versatile programming toolkits to manage the various data types, file formats,
and needs for scalability, simulation, visualization, and data exploration.\\
\textbf{Results:} We present version 2.0 of the Bio::Phylo libraries for phylogenetic data
analysis. This new release represents a rewrite of the internal architecture, allowing
for extensions that improve speed and persistence, as well as greatly increased 
functionality in terms of analysis, data reading and writing, and visualization.\\
\textbf{Availability:} The package is released as open source software under the same terms as 
Perl itself and available from the comprehensive Perl archive network as well as directly
from the source code repository.\\

\textbf{Supplementary information:} Supplementary data are available at \textit{Bioinformatics}
online.}

\maketitle

% RAV: here are some useful syntax tricks that we will need to observe:
% - refer to figures like so: 'Figure~\ref{fig:01}'
% - citations like this: '\citep{Bag01}' or like that: '\citet{Bag01}', citep is 
%   parenthisized, citet is in-text
% - equations as follows:
% \begin{equation}
% \sum \text{\it x}+ \text{\it y} =\text{\it Z}\label{eq:01}\vspace*{-10pt}
% \end{equation}
% which can then be referenced as Equation~(\ref{eq:01})

\section{Availability}

All revisions of the source code are available from the source code repository at
http://github.com/rvosa/bio-phylo. The latest stable release version, which is usually 
considerably far behind the latest source code revision, is available from the 
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) at http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bio-Phylo. 
Accompanying this publication is a uniquely identifiable release, stamped with a Digital 
Object Identifier (DOI) issued by Zenodo.org: \texttt{doi:10.5281/zenodo.tbd}.

As is a common convention in Perl software releases, a dual licensing scheme applies to
Bio::Phylo - both the Artistic License 
(https://github.com/rvosa/bio-phylo/blob/master/COPYING) as well as the GNU General Public 
License (https://github.com/rvosa/bio-phylo/blob/master/LICENSE) applies. This is 
generally interpreted to mean that you are free to choose whichever of these licenses fits 
best with your own project, should you want to reuse all (or part) of Bio::Phylo. This is 
certainly the spirit: feel free to use these libraries however you see fit. No warranties.
