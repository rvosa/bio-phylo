The latest revisions of the source code are available from the source code repository at
L<http://github.com/rvosa/bio-phylo>. The latest stable release version, which is usually 
considerably far behind the latest source code revision, is available from the Comprehensive
Perl Archive Network (CPAN) at L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bio-Phylo>. Accompanying this
publication is a uniquely identifiable release, stamped with a Digital Object
Identifier (DOI) issued by L<Zenodo.org>: C<doi:10.5281/zenodo.tbd>.

As is a common convention in Perl software releases, a dual licensing scheme applies to
Bio::Phylo - both the L<Artistic License|https://github.com/rvosa/bio-phylo/blob/master/COPYING>
as well as the L<GNU General Public License|https://github.com/rvosa/bio-phylo/blob/master/LICENSE>
applies. This is generally interpreted to mean that you are free to choose whichever of these
licenses fits best with your own project, should you want to reuse all (or part) of Bio::Phylo.
This is certainly the spirit: feel free to use these libraries however you see fit. 
No warranties.
