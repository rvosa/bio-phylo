=head2 Installation

Bio::Phylo can be installed automatically by a number of different package managers. However,
these usually rely on outdated versions, and because there is nothing that needs to be
compiled for the core installation there is no need to let a package manager do a system
wide installation, which is typically only useful for packages that include compiled
binaries and not just pure Perl source code. Bio::Phylo is pure Perl, so it is recommended 
to have the project's directory tree "cloned" from the source code repository 
(see Availability), and have the C<PERL5LIB> environment variable point to the C<lib> 
folder inside the directory tree. This way all functionality will be available in user 
scripts, and the user can update to the latest release (or skip back to any previous one) 
with a single command. Source code can be cloned from code repositories using the 
L<git|http://git-scm.org> tool on most common operating systems, it is outside of the scope 
of this document to discuss how this is done: good documentation for C<git> can be found 
L<online|https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/>. How to update an 
environment variable to add an additional location to it, on any particular operating 
system, is likewise best searched for online.

Although this is not the recommended way to install, Bio::Phylo is also available from CPAN, 
which means that any tools built around this system will be able to install the latest 
release, for example using the standard command line program C<cpan>, which is installed 
on almost any computer that has C<perl> installed. Installation from CPAN is typically the 
approach taken by a system administrator on high-performance computing infrastructure. 
Experienced Perl users commonly install the non-standard package management tool C<cpanm> 
(CPAN-minus, a play on the name of a previous tool called CPAN-plus), which is somewhat more 
user friendly, and it can install modules directly from GitHub (but then it will do a 
system-wide install that from that moment on cannot be updated from GitHub, so it is still 
better to check out the code as described above). Certain installations of Perl (historically, 
on Windows) include a package manager called C<ppm>. While this is very useful for hard-to-
install compiled extensions, this too relies on old versions of Bio::Phylo, so is best 
avoided, as are Linux-based package managers, such as C<apt-get> and C<yum>.

=head2 Availability

All revisions of the source code are available from the source code repository at
L<http://github.com/rvosa/bio-phylo>. The latest stable release version, which is usually 
considerably far behind the latest source code revision, is available from the Comprehensive
Perl Archive Network (CPAN) at L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bio-Phylo>. Accompanying this
publication is a uniquely identifiable release, stamped with a Digital Object
Identifier (DOI) issued by L<Zenodo.org>: C<doi:10.5281/zenodo.tbd>.

As is a common convention in Perl software releases, a dual licensing scheme applies to
Bio::Phylo - both the L<Artistic License|https://github.com/rvosa/bio-phylo/blob/master/COPYING>
as well as the L<GNU General Public License|https://github.com/rvosa/bio-phylo/blob/master/LICENSE>
applies. This is generally interpreted to mean that you are free to choose whichever of these
licenses fits best with your own project, should you want to reuse all (or part) of Bio::Phylo.
This is certainly the spirit: feel free to use these libraries however you see fit. 
No warranties.
