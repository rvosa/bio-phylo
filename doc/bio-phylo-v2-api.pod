=head1 The Bio::Phylo libraries for phyloinformatic analysis, version 2.0

=head1 Introduction

=head1 Installation

Bio::Phylo can be installed for you by a number of different package managers. However,
these usually rely on outdated versions, and because there is nothing that needs to be
compiled for the core installation, there is no need to let a package manager do a system
wide installation, which is typically only useful for packages that include compiled
binaries and not just pure Perl source code. Bio::Phylo is pure Perl, so my recommendation 
would be to have the project's directory tree checked out from the source code repository 
(see Availability), and have the C<PERL5LIB> environment variable point to the C<lib> 
folder inside the directory tree. This way all the functionality will be available in your 
scripts, and you can update to the latest release (or skip back to any previous one) with 
a single command. Assuming you have C<git> installed and you have navigated to the location
where the directory can be stored, the checkout is done as follows:

 # This downloads the source tree
 git clone https://github.com/rvosa/bio-phylo.git
 
 # This adds the location to PERL5LIB - Note: check to see if this is how environment
 # variables are added to the user profile of your operating system
 echo 'export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:'`pwd`/bio-phylo/lib >> ~/.bash_profile

Having said that, Bio::Phylo is also available from CPAN, which means that any tools built
around this system will be able to install the latest release, for example using the 
standard command line program C<cpan>, which is installed on almost any computer that has
C<perl> installed, such as on Linux and MacOSX. Experienced Perl users commonly install the
non-standard package management tool C<cpanm> (CPAN-minus, a play on the name of a previous 
tool called CPAN-plus), which is somewhat more user friendly, and it can install modules 
directly from GitHub (but then it will do a system-wide install that can't be updated from
GitHub, so it is still better to check out the code as described above).

=head1 Availability

The latest revisions of the source code are available from the source code repository at
L<http://github.com/rvosa/bio-phylo>. The latest stable release version, which is usually 
considerably far behind the latest source code revision, is available from the Comprehensive
Perl Archive Network (CPAN) at L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bio-Phylo>. Accompanying this
publication is a uniquely identifiable release, stamped with a Digital Object
Identifier (DOI) issued by L<Zenodo.org>: C<doi:10.5281/zenodo.tbd>.

As is a common convention in Perl software releases, a dual licensing scheme applies to
Bio::Phylo - both the L<Artistic License|https://github.com/rvosa/bio-phylo/blob/master/COPYING>
as well as the L<GNU General Public License|https://github.com/rvosa/bio-phylo/blob/master/LICENSE>
applies. This is generally interpreted to mean that you are free to choose whichever of these
licenses fits best with your own project, should you want to reuse all (or part) of Bio::Phylo.
This is certainly the spirit: feel free to use these libraries however you see fit. 
No warranties.
